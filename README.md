AI Trash Recognition Project
Overview
The AI Trash Recognition Project aims to leverage machine learning to accurately categorize waste into various categories such as recyclable, organic, and trash. This project is intended to help improve waste management and recycling processes, reducing the environmental impact of mismanaged waste.

Project Goals
Enhance Recycling Efficiency: Automate the process of sorting waste into correct categories to improve recycling rates.
Reduce Contamination: Lower the contamination in recycling bins by ensuring only appropriate waste is included.
Educational Tool: Serve as an educational tool to raise awareness about proper waste disposal and recycling practices.
Scalability: Develop a model that can be scaled and adapted to different waste management contexts, including residential and industrial settings.
