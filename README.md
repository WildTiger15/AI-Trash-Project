# AI Trash Recognition Project

The AI Trash Recognition Project aims to leverage machine learning to accurately categorize waste into various categories such as recyclable, organic, and trash. This project is intended to help improve waste management and recycling processes, reducing the environmental impact of mismanaged waste.

# Project Goals
Enhance Recycling Efficiency: Automate the process of sorting waste into correct categories to improve recycling rates.
Reduce Contamination: Lower the contamination in recycling bins by ensuring only appropriate waste is included.
Educational Tool: Serve as an educational tool to raise awareness about proper waste disposal and recycling practices.
Scalability: Develop a model that can be scaled and adapted to different waste management contexts, including residential and industrial settings.
Installation

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above
pip package manager
Access to a CUDA-compatible GPU for training or Cloud computing services like Azure (I used this)
Libraries
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-trash-recognition.git
cd ai-trash-recognition
Dataset
Prepare your dataset with images categorized into folders such as recyclable, organic, and trash. Make sure your dataset is structured like this:


dataset/
    recyclable/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    organic/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    trash/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...


# Model Training
To train the model, follow these steps:
Preprocess the Dataset: Preprocess your dataset to ensure the images are of uniform size and normalized.
Define the Model: Define your Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in TensorFlow.
Train the Model: Train your model on the dataset.

# Directions and Copy Code
Look at model.ipynb for code and copy past relevant sections. You can use the openCV camera format if liked
